One day I was wandering around the ranch and looking for some interesting things, and saw some chest mimics. I had seen the chest replicas around a lot (my local one and my own) but never did a real look at them before. Anyway, I had gone looking for them, so I decided to go look for them at my local farm. There are lots of them, so I went on and I thought about it, I think maybe there are several versions of the same chest, and when I saw them, I figured they would find a home (because, of course, they would have to have room for one) or, more likely, they would just be part of the story. So I asked my friend, my cousin Joe, from a farm near Austin, TX whether or not they did have chests with "face" or even legs to them. Joe asked if I had seen any, and I said I had, so I decided to take a peek, I noticed a bit of a difference. I have always been a tomboy since I was a kid, and that chest was quite pretty and very pretty to look at, much more handsome than any other of those pictures I have ever seen from him.
