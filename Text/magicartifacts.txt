Coat of Many Colors
===

The coat of many colors is a magic item, that must never die. The first to use it must know the whereabouts of the second. Once it has died, the owner will be unable to recover.

I must understand the significance of this mysterious item in order to protect my master.

"...Ah, sorry you lost your composure there"

When I said that, I unintentionally let go of the sword with my own hand. In front of the sword, there appeared no other than an enormous blade. As such, it was hard not to call this the largest knife in the Demon World.

When it came to size, it is larger than when compared to the two of us. That makes it impossible for us to grasp this weapon with our own hand.

With this information, the information that I have received from the Demon World was confirmed. The sword that I have received, is the Light Sword, the Light Sword of The First Sword. I had lost the original sword that I made when I made the second sword. After discovering all of the hidden information, because of that, the light sword that I made can not be classified as Light Sword of The First Sword.

I had discovered this sword in the Demon World as I was using the second sword at the time of the death of the master.

The Large Bag of Many Things
===
The large bag of many things is an artifact that can be used by any character. He who carries it needsn't fear. In fact, it encourages him to do more of what he likes to do. He can put this bag in, carry it, and then go out to do his work as quickly as he chose to do it. All he has to do is bring some of it home from work. The more he does, the farther away he is from the main task he wants to focus on. He may not ever want to do that type of work because there is nothing he can do to avoid it. It is much like the bag of many things being his car, where the purpose is to get from one place to another, where the purpose is to use and enjoy certain things and enjoy doing so. If one can put that bag in, then whatever they do can be done with all sorts of objects within that bag. That is why the bag is an especially valuable piece of equipment for everyone. When you are in the pursuit of something, make sure none of one's things becomes lost to you before finding you.

Mr. Bernard's Magic Amulet and Rings
===
Mr. Bernard's Magic Amulet and Rings are a set of artifacts that are most powerful when used together.  A magic amulet is an amulet made from a piece of enchanted material, that allows one to have a single effect.  This effect is different every time you cast the amulet.  If you put a certain spell into the amulet, it will always grant that effect at that instant, or allow that effect from the amulet to be stacked from three spells into another.  A ring is the only piece of jewelry on the game that can give a single effect from multiple magic accessories.  A ring will always give that effect on the first and last hit, or any attack for that matter, and it will never give anything from two different magic accessories. The Rings do stack.  So, when you put a spell into a ring, you are actually trying to stack that spell with other spells that would apply that spell to him on the same level of effect from the amulet.  If there's a spell that does that, the ring will not stack the enchantment that gives the spell. The ring can be sold for money, but the selling items for this effect is pretty expensive.


===
Mmylar's Magic Cloak and Boots
===
Mylar's Mmagic Cloak and Boots are designed for ranger characters. They have a 2/3 AC bonus to AC. These boots are light enough for someone like me who is going to be taking a lot of damage - however, if I don't have very high AC, they might be difficult to find. In addition, if I lose my AC at any point, these boots will drop and cannot be added to any boots I put on.

When you use a special action to remove your rogue level to 0 as a swift action, the boots you are wearing now have AC equal to 10 + your Constitution modifier.

The boots fit like a glove, as you can see, and there's no additional weight added. However, they do not have a leather collar attached, and any weight the boots add is a bonus to Dexterity saving throws. All of this changes immediately after the boots have been unequipped, so any weight you take from those boots remains.

The special item you take is not part of the shield, but it's still worn as part of the regular armor, and thus it also counts towards the number of AC that the items normally offer. So, a shield that grants you a +2 bonus to AC would be made up to 5 AC points.

Konzo's Ring of Warding
===
Konzo's Ring of Warding was forged by the wizard Konzo for his secret partner. This ring would turn out to give him an immense amount of magical power, allowing him to fight against other heroes and villains of his time period. Though only capable of using a small portion of his powers, the ring was not just for self protection when the time came and all other magic users who had been around him would have to use a ring with a greater power to stay alive. However, the ring's power was vastly greater than for the first two rings and, according to one of the ring's members, "this Ring was much more powerful than the first and I'm sure I'm not the only one that can attest to that." However, by the time of the events of the Marvel Manga, this ring had been altered to serve as a shield by the demon Kihara Gensei. As a result, those without the ring in their possession cannot touch or use it.

Konzo made the ring through the use of Kihara Gensei, who had acquired it during his time as a hero and was in high demand as a magician. In order to prevent the ring from being stolen, Gensei made a deal with Konzo that allowed Konzo to use his magical power and get free.


===
Sztronius's Ring of Stealthiness
===
It is said that whenever an elf wanders into Vilemaw's Lair without the rings to protect himself, she must take them back while being stunned. It is possible that Zoltan's ring gives him the same benefit. It is unknown why this is, however.

The Ring of Sustenance is the primary ring of power for the Elfbane. This ring acts as protection from physical harm, and does not grant him invisibility/glare. The rings only protect his vision and his strength from physical attacks.

The Ring of the Mind is the highest tier ring for the Elfbane and has a similar effect to the Ring of Perception for the elf. Once used, the Elfbane will have the rings appear around his/her field of vision as if someone had used them, however, the rings only give him an increase in vision-range, in addition, they cannot damage those who wear them.

It is unknown what is the reason for using the rings when the Ring of the Mind has a lower Power modifier. It has only an average range (20 squares), and does not produce any aura.

Benny's Amulet of Warding
===
According to Mr. Tully, "In ancient times the Benny statue was hidden in a well at the city's central square where it had been raised from the bottom of the ravine. Once the plowing was done the statue was lifted up into the sky, but it was left untouched for one last battle, to which the citizens of Benny's Cove fought hard; as the battle was going on the citizens of Benny's Amulet used the amulet to ward off the evil of evil and sent the amulet to its rightful resting place, hidden in the ravine." This might sound like the sort of thing that someone who didn't like evil should want to be buried with... but I really don't know.

It is thought that Mr. Tully was one of the men who gave Benny his belt buckle, while he lived with Polly, who was a wealthy and influential woman in Benny's Cove at the time.

When the town received the amulet it was discovered (much to the delight of Benny and Polly) by a group of people from the local church, who had a great deal of success in their mission of building a cathedral.

i-Tessi's Ring of Poison Destruction
===
i-Tessi's Ring of Poison Destruction is a coveted ring by assassins, pickpurses, and royal guards. This is not as dangerous as a weapon made specially for hunting, but it is still deadly if placed on the wrong hands.

When you are killed, Tessi makes you stand under the banner of Queen Albedo. She tells you that, in the wake of his downfall, she has sought out his followers and is now a member of the Order of the Black Knight. Albedo grants you a Ring of the Sword to gain access to the throne room.

In the Castle's Hall, you will be attacked from several sides by various monsters, which will lead to the entrance of the Palace. Albedo and Tessi, the Knight-Servant of Queen Albedo will attack if you kill one of their subjects, but if you do not kill them before they die, you will be forced to face them again and they will all die in similar ways.

===
The Ring of the Wounded
===
The Ring of the Wounded is a ring made of dragon bone which grants a bonus to all AC when wearing light armor. The wearer of this ring takes 1 point of Wisdom damage if caught in an unarmed strike by a creature with less than 14 Hit Dice.

When an object of magical power is used against or against the ring, both the ring and that object gain bonus armor, and the ring takes fire damage instead.

When wearing the Ring of the Wounded, a character gains the following benefits:

When an attack is made against the wearer of the Ring of the Wounded, and both the attacker and the wearer are within 15 feet of the wearer, the attack gains the effects of the Flame Blade feat.

While wearing the Ring of the Wounded, when performing a melee attack against a target that is within 5 feet of the wearer, any ranged creature within that range is automatically staggered and loses any saving throws it makes against the attack and provokes attacks of opportunity as it attempts to resist. This does not apply to unarmed strikes made by the wearer, or attacks against or against the wielder of any other weapon. (In a single instance of this feat, each creature has a number of saving throws equal to its Constitution modifier. The wearer of the Ring of the Wounded receives a bonus to these saving throws at the start of each of his turns.


===
Barding of Festering Anger
===
When wearing the Barding of Festering Anger, a hero's steed will take on the appearance and voice of the wearer, granting them bonus attacks with a small power and a number of penalties equal to half the hero's level. The hero can then take advantage of all the bonuses from the steed, as long as they are not wearing the Barding.

Starting at 6th level, once per day you can add up to 5d12 fire damage to those entering your reach without taking damage. While wearing the Barding or any other armor, the user rolls up to 2d12 points of bonus damage, but they take this extra damage at the end of each turn while also wearing the Barding of Festering Anger.

At 9th level, the number of times the Barding of Festering Rage has been applied increases to 20, and every time the Barding of Festering Rage has been applied, you can use your reaction to attempt to use the Bardic Inspiration skill on your steed. Starting at 12th level, the Bardics Inspiration skill uses your total number of steed charges as it would for it's ranks in Athletics (maximum 10). 


===
The Ring of Enfeebling Blows
===
The Ring of Enfeebling Blows is a curious artifact.

You don't get the ring when you destroy the Ring of Enfeebling Blows. A ring destroyed here does not destroy the Ring, it provides your character with the ability to cast Enfeeble for free. It is then possible for a character to use their Enfeeblings in a way that turns them back into a human, but the power is lost in a very brief period of time.

If you do not already have the ring, the Ring of Enfeebling Blows might be able to help your character gain that ability and possibly allow you to cast spells, including, though not necessarily limited to, the spells listed below which use the Enfeeble spell and/or spell slots of the Ring as their source of ammunition:

Fireball: The fireball is cast at close range from within your Ring of Encumbrance and, when it hits, ignites a flaming pit of pure flame that engulfs all foes, including yourself! As a bonus action, you may add 1d4 bonus to your AC for the duration of the fireball.

Choke: The effect of this spell is to put yourself into a very stifling air of fear, and in the next 1d4 rounds any creatures in that environment take 1d6 psychic damage. This damage may be dealt multiple times per round.


===
The Ring of the Mantle of the Mule
===
The Ring of the Mantle of the Mule was probably created by one of the trickster gods.

Possible Gods who might be associated with that ring include:
 - The Lord of War
 - Harpo-Mage
 - Lord of Chaos
 - Lord of Illusion
 - Lord of Misery
 - Dragon Knight
 - Chaos Lord
 - Prince of Lies
 - Emperor of Demons
 - Archfiend of the Abyss
 - Lord of Madness

This is the first one to take the title of Ring. The last was the last. So they call this one the Ring of the Mule.

This is the first of a series of the Nine Realms of the World of Ooga. The first was called the Heavens in Ooga.

The first One True Ring was shown to be by Ooga when he was the lord of the Underworld; Ooga the god of chaos; in the story "The Last of the Nors". In this world, there was another ring in the middle of the land, called the Ring of the Lord of the Underworld.

It was originally the Ring from which All the Ones who had died in Purgatory came back to life. This one is also the Ring from which the Nors came into existence, just as the Nors from Hell came into existence in Purgatory.

This One True Ring is not even the original one from which all the Ones who died in Purgatory came back to life in the World of Ooga. Ooga created the ring of the lord of the Underworld after seeing the great destruction his followers caused. Ooga came at his own cost. The ring is now an important thing and in the past there were problems with it.
