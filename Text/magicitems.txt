a silver pommel. In addition, there is an unusual weapon hidden in the castle, called "The White Horse", which is a golden, curved, pendant-shaped weapon that may have been used from the beginning or it may have been invented specifically for the purpose of taking vengeance on a powerful chieftain. This object was also mentioned by the chieftain to her young daughter who had been captured by one of the other chieftains, that he had given the chieftain's wife to a spy from the other chieftains, she became the mother of this beautiful young princess.

Sage Long Sword (Mythic Quality): This greatsword is a greatsword forged for a fallen race of gods named the Sage, the most powerful races of the plane. To achieve their greatest feats, these masters craft incredible weapons and armor, all of which are crafted according to a unique pattern. 

The Great Shield of the Drow (Drow Greatsword)  -  A greatsword that is so impressive that even the most cowardly of warriors must be impressed by its massive size, imposing blade guard and sheer size. When wielded by a human, its power and damage is equivalent to that of a heavy greatsword which is usually referred to by the names of a greatsword and a greataxe. It has the same special properties as a greataxe. A drow master wielding the shield deals as much slashing damage as he or she wields his or her main hand weapon, but must attack with a melee weapon he or she carries first to activate its damage and increase its critical strike chance. The shield can be upgraded to a greatsword at level 16 (which gains additional properties), though the cost increases the wielder's cost for other upgrades as well. The cost is reduced by 25% for each level after 6th (the total cost per level at level 21 of each upgrade is now 400 gp and the total increase is increased to 500 gp).

4) Shield of the Dead  -  A short-range light protective shield that allows you to temporarily reduce the amount of incoming damage you receive. On a hit with this shield, your AC remains at 15 until the end of your next turn; your AC does not increase until it has doubled, or until your shield is destroyed. If you are hit and still taking damage before this shield is destroyed, that damage is ignored.

Shield of Drow Wisdom is a class feature only.
